# Deep-Learning

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the final project of the course "Deep Learning" of the Master in Data Science at the University of Barcelona. The project consists of the implementation of a deep learning model to solve a classification problem. The dataset used is the CIFAR-100.

## 2. CIFAR-100 Dataset
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
